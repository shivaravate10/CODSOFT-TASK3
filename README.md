Title: "CodeSoft Coding Task2"

CodeSoft Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects . We've tackled a variety of problems to showcase our data analysis and predictive modeling skills.

Project 3: IRIS Classification
Overview
In this project, we demonstrate a classic classification problem using the IRIS dataset. Our goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. We've used popular machine learning algorithms and provided detailed code and documentation to help you understand the process.
